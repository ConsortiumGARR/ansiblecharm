summary: Subordinate charm to run an Ansible playbook from a git repository against localhost.
description: |
  This subordinate Charm fetches an ansible playbook from a git repository
  and then executes it on localhost.
  
  The rationale behind this Charm is that 1) the idempotency provided by
  Ansible seem to fit the idempotency required by Juju Charm hook
  implementations, 2) there are several ready to go Ansible playbooks available
  online, 3) DevOps which prefer Ansible over scripting are facilitated.
